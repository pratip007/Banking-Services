        <b>Welcome to simple Banking</b> 
        <p> A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates 
            a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans.[1] Lending activities can be directly
             performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.

            Banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, 
            most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks. Most countries 
            have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking, under which banks
             hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. 
             In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally
              subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards,
               the Basel Accords.
            
            Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities 
            of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts 
            of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking,
             a number of banking dynasties — notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, 
             and the Rothschilds — have played a central role over many centuries. 
             The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472),
              while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590).</p>
